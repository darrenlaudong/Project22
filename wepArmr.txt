Weapon stats:
In Gladius, your weapon is your life, there are several to chose
from to fit your own preferred playstyle.

All One-Handed Weapons are paired with a shield which will increase
your ability to block damage

Base Damage - this is the minimum amount of damage if you hit.

Weapon Speed - the higher the number, the less likely your attack
will be blocked or parried

Weapon Reach - longer reaches provide additional defensive bonuses
as well as counter attack opportunities

Defensive Bonus - defensive bonus for chosing a two handed weapon
over a one hand and a shield

Agility Loss - larger heavier weapons that do more damage are also
harder to swing. They do more damage, but can be blocked easier.

Armor Stats:
Armor only has two stats, Defensive Bonus and Agility Loss. These
represent the ability for you to block incoming damage, but also
the loss of mobility to either dodge or parry incoming attacks.
