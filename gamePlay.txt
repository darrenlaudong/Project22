Glatiator is played in alternating rounds of combat where you and
your opponent select actions and carry them out. Both actions are
acted out at the same time. For example, if you chose to block and
your opponent choses also to block, the round will end and new
actions will be selected. If you chose to dodge and your opponent 
choses to attack, combat will be resolved.

Combat ends when one player falls to 1 health or below. At the
end of Combat the Emperor will pass judgement upon the fallen.
based on the amount of favor they have earned. The less favor
the more likely it is that the Emperor will let the gladiator die
to please the crowd. The more favor, the more likely they will be
glorified for their achievements.
